## üîß Setup

### Firebase Setup

1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication and Firestore in your project
3. Generate a new web app in your Firebase project and copy the configuration
4. Generate a new service account key for the admin SDK:
   - Go to Project Settings > Service Accounts
   - Click "Generate New Private Key"
   - Save the JSON file as `serviceAccountKey.json` in the `backend` directory

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Update the `.env` file with your API keys and Firebase configuration:
   ```
   FLASK_APP=app.py
   FLASK_ENV=development
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=serviceAccountKey.json
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
   FINNHUB_API_KEY=your-finnhub-api-key
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file based on `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

4. Update the `.env.local` file with your Firebase configuration:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
